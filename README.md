# glacial_runoff_mapping
Repository holds code for an interactive map which visualizes across-century glacial runoff trends for 75 globally-distributed river basins (3 glacier evolution models). App can be found here: https://fwimberly.shinyapps.io/Global_Glacier_Runoff/

This application was developed to supplement a manuscript. The paper breaks down driving factors behind differing runoff projections between glacier models and summarizes regional runoff trends. The manuscript can be accessed in prepint form at: https://egusphere.copernicus.org/preprints/2024/egusphere-2024-1778/
